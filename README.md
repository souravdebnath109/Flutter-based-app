# Flutter-based-app
A Flutter-based BMI Calculator app allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The app provides the BMI score along with a category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) and a health recommendation based on the result. It's a simple and intuitive tool for tracking fitness and health.
